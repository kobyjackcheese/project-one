Project One:

Rock Paper Scissors

this will be a game where you play rock paper scissors against a computer. perhaps when i am finished with the basics of the project i might make the computer make choices based on the player's past selections.

i will make a section of the page that shows the past selections of both the player and the computer.

player should be able to click a button, making a selection which then triggers the computer to make its own selection (based on the past 10 selections) and then displaying the results and who wins, along with keeping track of the score. (ai is reset after the 10 rounds is over)



finished game: 

player plays rock paper scissors against my ai and must face a nearly inevitable loss. the player with the highest score after 10 rounds wins.
