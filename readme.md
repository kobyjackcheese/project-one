Project One:

Rock Paper Scissors

this will be a game where you play rock paper scissors against a computer. perhaps when i am finished with the basics of the project i might make the computer make choices based on the player's past selections.

i will try and make a section of the page that shows the past selections of both the player and the computer.

player should be able to click a button, making a selection which then triggers the computer to make its own selection (maybe based on the past 5 or so selections) and then displaying the results and who wins.
