Project One:

(almost) Unbeatable Rock Paper Scissors (made with HTML, CSS, and javaScript)

this will be a game where you play rock paper scissors against a computer. after 10 rounds, the player with the highest score wins.

player should be able to click a button, making a selection which then triggers the computer to make its own selection (based on the past 10 selections) and then displaying the results and who wins, along with keeping track of the score. (ai is reset after the 10 rounds is over)
